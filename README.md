## Description

This is a simple weather web application built using Flask. It provides current weather information and a 5-day weather forecast based on the city or your current location. The app is styled with custom CSS and uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data. The frontend is designed with HTML templates and CSS for styling.

# My Story ðŸŒŸ
I was inspired to create this Weather App during a rainy week when I wanted to check the weather easily. I wanted a project that could utilize my Flask skills and provide real-time data. The technical challenge was integrating the OpenWeatherMap API, as I had never worked with external APIs before. 

At first, I struggled with understanding API calls and handling JSON data. After several attempts and some late nights, I finally managed to fetch the data correctly! For future iterations, I envision adding features like user accounts, a more detailed historical weather analysis, and even a mobile version of the app. This project not only enhanced my coding skills but also reinforced my passion for creating user-friendly applications.
